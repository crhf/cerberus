# Extending the Framework

The framework can be extended to support additional programming languages, repair tools and bug benchmarks. Additional
features that take advantage of tool abstractions can be implemented.

Possible Extensions:

* Repair Tool (see [how to add a tool](tool/AddTool.md))
* Bug Benchmark (see [how to add a benchmark](benchmark/AddBenchmark.md))
* Task Profile (see [how to add a task profile](profile/AddTaskProfile.md))
* Container Profile (see [how to add a container profile](profile/AddContainerProfile.md))
* Higher Level Features for Repair
* Integration with Analysis Tools
